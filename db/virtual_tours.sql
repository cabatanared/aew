After irradiation, these components have a larger capacity for electricity to pass through and are more electrical resistant than before, respectively.\n\nSome materials are functionalized for a certain purpose like our abaca fabric that can adsorb heavy metals in water.\n\nThere are many applications of radiation in our everyday life.

Enzymes don\'t create change in and of themselves. Rather they lower the threshold activation energy required for a reaction to proceed. As you may have learned in school, enzymes do this without being consumed themselves. After catalyzing a change to the point where the system reaches equilibrium, having achieved an optimal state, enzymes figuratively step back and watch for new reactions to speed up. When the biological conditions are right, the enzyme is there. When the student is ready, the teacher appears.
