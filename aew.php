          This weeklong celebration highlighting the latest innovations in nuclear science and technology is mandated under Presidential Proclamation No. 1211 in 1973 which declared December 7 to 15, and the second week of every year, as Atomic Energy Week. It was part of the government’s efforts to generate awareness of the Filipino people on the beneficial uses of nuclear science and technology. <br><br>

          In the said proclamation, the government noted the extraordinary advances in science and technology due to the use of atomic energy as a “versatile tool in research and development.” The proclamation also noted that nuclear energy is a “major source of power,” thus there was a need to push atomic energy development in the country as a vital factor in nation building. <br><br>

          The Proclamation directed the then Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, now the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI), which is tasked to promote and advance the beneficial uses of atomic energy in the Philippines, to undertake activities for the AEW.
